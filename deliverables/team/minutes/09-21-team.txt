Contact with Partner TODO List
-----------------------------
- Product manager contacts the partner to discuss:

	- create "/deliverables/team/" directory.
		- add "Team-[Team NO.]-[Team Name].csv" (member number, utorid, student name, github_id, enroll_status, roles).
		- add "minutes/" directory to store meeting records.
		- add "Stakeholders.txt" to store: 1. partner contact; 2. TA contact.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Thursday November 16, 2023
 * Where: Online

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.


 * 2 - 4 important decisions, processes, actions, or anything else that worked well for you, ordered from most to least important.
 * Give a supporting argument about what makes you think that way.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

2. Our development process is meticulously structured to prevent conflicts between teams by separating both backend and frontend code. We leverage Github Workflows for continuous integration tests, employing four primary automation workflows. These encompass CI for the backend, CD for the backend, CI/CD for the database, and CI/CD for the frontendâ€”all seamlessly integrated onto an EC2 instance. These workflows are triggered by various actions such as pull requests, pushes/merges to the main branch, or specific file alterations.

 * This streamlined approach ensures effortless and automated deployment, maintaining a continuously operational main version while validating every build before integration into the main branch. This not only simplifies deployment but also guarantees a stable and reliable codebase at all times and a single version of a database that everyone can work with. https://github.com/csc301-2023-fall/project-48-yorkregioneducationalservices-T/actions TODO format ur to say link

#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

 * Keep this very short (1-3 lines).


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*

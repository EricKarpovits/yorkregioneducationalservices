# YRES Scheduler 
​​
## Partner Intro
 * Include the names, emails, titles, primary or secondary point of contact at the partner organization
 * Provide a short description about the partner organization. (2-4 lines)

## Description about the project
Keep this section very brief.
 * Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
 * What is the problem you're trying to solve? Is there any context required to understand **why** the application solves this problem?

The product is a web application that generates student summer camp schedules using an inputted floor plan and user data. The value is the simplification of the scheduling process, the accuracy afforded, and the ease of distribution for the schedule. This solves the problem of the course coordinators having to manually create schedules accounting for various factors and the distributing of the schedules.
​
## Key Features
 * Describe the key features in the application that the user can access.
 * Provide a breakdown or detail for each feature.
 * This section will be used to assess the value of the features built
​
## Instructions (To Be Determined)
 * Clear instructions for how to use the application from the end-user's perspective
 * How do you access it? For example: Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described in the previous section.
 * This section is critical to testing your application and must be done carefully and thoughtfully.
 
 ## Development requirements
 * What are the technical requirements for a developer to set up on their machine or server (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application. You should address this part like how one would expect a README doc of real-world deployed application would be.
 * You can see this [example](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup#readme) to get started.
 
 ## Deployment and Github Workflow
​
Describe your Git/GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members share codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.
​
 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live application
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using? And how?
 * Don't forget to **briefly justify why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

 ## Coding Standards and Guidelines
 Keep this section brief, a maximum of 2-3 lines. You would want to read through this [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/coding-standards-and-guidelines/) to get more context about what this section is for before attempting to answer.
  * These are 2 optional resources that you might want to go through: [article with High level explanation](https://blog.codacy.com/coding-standards-what-are-they-and-why-do-you-need-them/) and [this article with Detailed Explanation](https://google.github.io/styleguide/)

 ## Licenses 
​
Why the MIT license?
* Simplicity: It's clear, allows virtually unrestricted use, and our partners were okay with it.
* Popularity: Many open-source projects use it, thus it is widely recognized and understood. 
* No Copyleft: Flexible for various uses as someone that takes this project, makes modifications, and distributes their modified version aren’t required to be open-sourced.

Impacts on the codebase + development:
* Freedom: Anyone can use, modify, or distribute the code, including for commercial purposes.
* No Warranty: The software is provided "as-is".
* Attribution: Users must include the original MIT license text when using the code.
* Openness: While encouraging contributions, the license doesn't ensure all modifications remain open-source.
